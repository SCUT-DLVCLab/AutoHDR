</div>

## 🌟 Highlights
![Vis_1](images/pipeline.png)
![Vis_2](images/example.png)
- We propose a novel fully Automated solution for HDR **(AutoHDR)** , inspired by mirroring the workflow of expert historians.
- We introduce a pioneer Full-Page HDR dataset **(FPHDR)**, which supports comprehensive HDR model training and evaluation. 
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method on both text and appearance restoration.
- The modular design enables flexible adjustments, allowing AutoHDR to collaborate effectively with historians.
